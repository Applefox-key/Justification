# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is designed to assist AI testers in crafting supporting comments to justify the selection between two answer choices. It simplifies the process of providing clear and structured reasoning by offering the following features:

Voice Input: Allows users to input comments via voice, enhancing ease of use and speed.
Comment Formatting: Supports text formatting, enabling testers to create well-structured and clear comments.
Comment History: Automatically stores a history of all comments, with the option to export this history to a text file for further analysis or record-keeping.
Instruction Import: Facilitates the import of instructions from an Excel file (.xls) with multiple sheets. The file must adhere to a specific format:
The first three columns should contain the main text, a comment about it, and a label.
The next two columns should include the label and a short description of it.
This project aims to streamline the AI testing process, making it more efficient and effective for testers.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
